{"data":[["2","Smells Like Children Vinyl","Smells Like Children can be credited as the album that first put Marilyn Manson on the map with the hit single “Sweet Dreams” a cover of the pop-hit single from The Eurythmics. This very rare vinyl copy of the album features the iconic image of a bright green and menacing Marilyn Manson in a top hat, and on the back is another rare pic from one of the band’s earliest photo shoots (including the original guitarist Daisy Berkowitz) Though Marilyn Manson himself has stated in his autobiography that the Smells Like Children was a disaster, it still stands as a rare gem in his hard-rocking catalog.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51CTGmoHRQL._SX425_.jpg","$350.00","http://amzn.to/2DymOAh","Available in both new and used conditions."],["4","Portrait of an American Family Vinyl","It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. The early days of Marilyn Manson (And The Spooky Kids) were full of color, decadence and freakishly outlandish stage antics that we will never see again! Marilyn Manson himself noted that the band’s evolution from Portrait and Smells Like Children to Antichrist Superstar was a change from a punk-rock driven, cartoonish image to a darker sound and a much more serious image. Regardless, the Portrait of an American Family (also known as the Spooky Kids era) showcases the very exciting rise of the Antichrist Superstar from cross-dressing, striped-socks dawned freak show to the Antichrist Superstar himself. Features the band’s earliest hit songs “Lunchbox” “Get Your Gun” and “Cake and Sodomy.” ","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/519Og1HbbbL._SX425_.jpg","$369.00","http://amzn.to/2B3bvx5","Also comes with the rare Portrait of an American Family shirt."],["5","Holywood Vinyl","One of Marilyn Manson’s most brutally honest and controversial albums in his career – Holywood (In The Shadow Of The Valley Of Death – can now be added to your vinyl collection! Released in November of the year 2000 in the dark light of the Columbine shootings (in which Marilyn Manson was widely blamed for), this album demonstrated the band’s return to industrial and harder rock sounds in comparison to the polished, glam-rock Mechanical Animals.

We used to love ourselves, we used to love one another.\" Here's an extremely rare treasure straight from 1998 - Marilyn Manson's arguably best album Mechanical Animals on vinyl!

It marks the stark transformation from the colorful, tongue-in-cheek and rather cartoonish imagery of the Portrait of an American Family and Smells Like Children eras to an incredibly darker, angrier and ever-more controversial masterpiece. Antichrist Superstar truly rose Marilyn Manson to fame and put him on the map to stay, reaching #3 on the pop charts upon its release. Hordes of god-fearing Christians rallied against him, infamously protesting his concerts (some of them still do) but little did they know that they were merely adding fuel to the fire that is Antichrist Superstar.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51FRxuViCnL.jpg","$497.90","http://amzn.to/2mCoHEf","Available in both new and used conditions."]]}
